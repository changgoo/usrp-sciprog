# Computing infrastructure: setting up your adroit environment

Most of this page has been presented to you already on Day 1. We repeat here what is specifically required for running hydro simulations on the `adroit` cluster.

We will first explain how to connext to `adroit` using `ssh` on the Terminal window of your laptop or using a Web interface.

We will then explain how to set up the software environment on `adroit` using the `module load` command.

## Using the Terminal window on your laptop

You first need to install an X sever and a Terminal window manager.

For MacOS, use:

- iTerm for the Terminal window [click here to download](https://iterm2.com)
- XQuartz for the X server [click here to download](https://www.xquartz.org)

For Windows, use:

- PuTTY or KiTTY to connect remotely using the ssh protocol [click here to download](https://www.putty.org)
- Xming for the X server [click here to doanload](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/)
